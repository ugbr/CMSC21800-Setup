1. There might be an error in the process of cleaning. To make sure such errors are reversible, it's a good idea to keep the original data and make new file for the cleaned version.

2. Logging every run can provide data for the code. If some error appears in one of the programs, we can refer to the log file to understand where things went wrong. From a statistical viewpoint, logging provides us with quanities such as the running frequency for each application, which may help us determine things like the most used program. From an ethical viewpoint, if we're using a code provided by a third-party for our own project, tracking every run of the code provides us with data regarding the usage of the code and could help us give the credit where it's due.
